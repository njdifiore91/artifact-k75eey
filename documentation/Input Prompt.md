#### **WHY - Vision & Purpose**

**Purpose & Users:**  
This mobile application will generate interactive knowledge graphs contextualizing historical, cultural, and artistic elements underpinning a specific piece of art. It serves art enthusiasts, historians, educators, students, and researchers, providing an engaging tool to explore connections between an artwork and its historical context, stylistic influences, and related events or figures.  
**Why this application?**  
Existing tools focus on textual or static analysis with limited interactivity, which is better suited to desktop experiences. This app leverages the portability and intuitive touch interactions of mobile devices, enabling users to explore art-related knowledge on the go.

#### **WHAT - Core Requirements**

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Art Analysis:**

   - Users must upload or select a piece of art using their mobile device.

   - The system must analyze metadata, style, period, artist, and associated movements.

2. **Knowledge Graph Generation:**

   - The system must create an interactive graph connecting:

     - The artwork to its historical context.

     - Related artists, movements, and events.

     - Symbolic or cultural meanings associated with the art.

3. **Data Sources:**

   - The system must integrate with established art databases (e.g., Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus, Wikidata, Google Arts & Culture API).

4. **Interactive Exploration:**

   - Users must navigate the knowledge graph by tapping or swiping nodes to expand relationships.

   - Include filtering by date, theme, geography, and cultural significance.

5. **Export & Sharing:**

   - Users must export knowledge graphs as image files.

   - The system must support sharing graphs via unique URLs or integration with social apps.

----------

#### **HOW - Planning & Implementation**

**Technical Foundation:**

- **Frontend:**

  - Mobile app for iOS and Android using frameworks like Flutter or React Native for cross-platform development.

  - Graph rendering using libraries optimized for mobile, such as ECharts or D3.js adapted for touch interactions.

- **Backend:**

  - Data processing using Python (e.g., with SpaCy and Pandas for metadata parsing).

  - Neo4j or a graph database for storing and querying knowledge graphs.

- **Integrations:**

  - APIs for accessing art history databases and metadata repositories.

- **Infrastructure:**

  - Cloud-based hosting with scalable backend services accessible from mobile.

**System Requirements:**

- Performance: Ensure smooth graph rendering and animations on mobile devices.

- Security: Encrypted uploads, API connections, and compliance with mobile platform requirements.

- Scalability: Handle concurrent users generating and interacting with large graphs.

#### **User Experience**

**Key User Flows:**

1. **Uploading or Selecting Art:**

   - **Entry Point:** User opens the app and selects "Upload Art" or "Search Art Database" from the home screen.

   - **Key Steps:**

     - Upload an image or search using keywords.

     - Confirm or edit auto-populated metadata (title, artist, year).

   - **Success Criteria:** Metadata is parsed correctly, and a preliminary graph is generated.

2. **Exploring the Knowledge Graph:**

   - **Entry Point:** User clicks "Generate Knowledge Graph."

   - **Key Steps:**

     - View the graph with zoomable, draggable nodes for touch navigation.

     - Expand nodes by tapping to reveal additional connections.

     - Use swipe gestures or dropdown filters for date, theme, or geography.

   - **Success Criteria:** The user explores relationships intuitively with smooth transitions.

3. **Exporting and Sharing:**

   - **Entry Point:** User clicks "Export/Share" on the graph view.

   - **Key Steps:**

     - Select export format (e.g., image) or share directly via app integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, email).

   - **Success Criteria:** Graphs are exported or shared seamlessly.

**Core Interfaces:**

- **Home Screen:** Upload or search interface with shortcuts for recent activities.

- **Graph View:** Centralized space for exploring and interacting with the knowledge graph.

- **Details Panel:** Pop-up modal showing node-specific information like event details or artist biography.

#### **Business Requirements**

1. **Access & Authentication:**

   - Free tier with basic features and limited graph depth.

   - Premium tier with full database access and export capabilities.

2. **Business Rules:**

   - Ensure data accuracy by cross-referencing multiple sources.

   - Review user-uploaded metadata for copyright compliance.

3. **Implementation Priorities:**

   - **High Priority:** Art analysis and graph generation.

   - **Medium Priority:** Exporting and sharing features.

   - **Lower Priority:** Advanced filtering options.

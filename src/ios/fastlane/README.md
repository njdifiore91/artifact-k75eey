- `TEAM_ID`
- `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`

## Available Lanes

### Development

```bash
fastlane build_development
```

Builds the app for development environment:
- Signs with development certificates
- Runs comprehensive test suite
- Includes debug symbols
- Disables bitcode
- Supports iOS 14.0+

### Staging

```bash
fastlane build_staging
```

Builds and deploys to TestFlight:
- Signs with App Store certificates
- Includes bitcode and symbols
- Runs extended health checks
- Distributes to internal testers
- Supports iOS 14.0+

### Production

```bash
fastlane deploy_production
```

Deploys to App Store using blue/green strategy:
- Increments version numbers
- Signs with production certificates
- Includes full symbolication
- Performs staged rollout
- Supports iOS 14.0+

### Testing

```bash
fastlane run_tests
```

Executes comprehensive test suite:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- UI tests
- Generates coverage reports
- Minimum coverage: 80%

## Security Configuration

### Certificate Management

Managed through `match`:
- Git-based storage
- Encrypted certificates
- Automatic rotation
- Strict access control
- Read-only CI access

### Code Signing

Secure signing process:
- Development profiles
- Distribution profiles
- Enterprise profiles
- Automatic provisioning
- Device management

## Deployment Strategy

### Blue/Green Deployment

Production releases use blue/green deployment:
1. Build new version
2. Deploy to TestFlight
3. Run health checks
4. Gradual App Store rollout
5. Monitor metrics
6. Auto-rollback on failure

### Rollback Procedure

Automatic rollback triggers if:
- Health checks fail
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Critical bugs detected
- Deployment timeout reached

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

Continuous monitoring of:
- Build status
- Test coverage
- Deployment status
- App performance
- Crash reports

### Metrics

Key metrics tracked:
- Build time
- Test duration
- Deployment time
- Error rates
- User adoption

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Certificate Errors
   - Run `fastlane match nuke`
   - Re-sync certificates
   - Verify team permissions

2. Build Failures
   - Clear DerivedData
   - Update cocoapods
   - Verify signing settings

3. Deployment Issues
   - Check App Store Connect
   - Verify provisioning
   - Monitor health metrics

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Procedures

1. Certificate Recovery
   - Access backup certificates
   - Regenerate if needed
   - Update match repository

2. Build Recovery
   - Revert to last stable
   - Clear build artifacts
   - Rebuild from scratch

3. Deployment Recovery
   - Trigger auto-rollback
   - Restore previous version
   - Monitor stability

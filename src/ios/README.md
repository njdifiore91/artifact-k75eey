## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- Xcode 14.0+ with Command Line Tools
- Ruby 2.7.0+ (installed via rbenv)
- CocoaPods 1.12.0+
- fastlane 2.217.0+
- SwiftLint 0.50.0+

### Required Access
- Apple Developer Program membership
- Development team access (Team ID: ARTKG12345)
- GitHub repository access
- Code signing certificate access

## Environment Setup

### 1. Development Environment

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Install Ruby via rbenv
brew install rbenv
rbenv install 2.7.0
rbenv global 2.7.0

# Install CocoaPods
gem install cocoapods -v 1.12.0

# Install fastlane
gem install fastlane -v 2.217.0

# Install SwiftLint
brew install swiftlint
```

### 2. Security Configuration

```bash
# Configure code signing
fastlane match development
fastlane match appstore

# Set up keychain access
security create-keychain -p "" build.keychain
security list-keychains -s build.keychain
security default-keychain -s build.keychain
security unlock-keychain -p "" build.keychain
```

### 3. Application Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:artknowledgegraph/ios-app.git
cd ios-app

# Install dependencies
pod install

# Open workspace
open ArtKnowledgeGraph.xcworkspace
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Configuration

Set required environment variables:
```bash
export DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="ARTKG12345"
export NEWRELIC_APP_TOKEN="your_token"
export SENTRY_DSN="your_dsn"
export APP_ENVIRONMENT="development"
```

### 2. Build Configuration

Supported configurations:
- Debug: Development builds with debugging enabled
- Staging: TestFlight builds with monitoring
- Release: Production builds with optimizations

### 3. Code Quality

```bash
# Run SwiftLint
swiftlint

# Run tests
fastlane run_tests

# Generate coverage report
fastlane run_tests generate_coverage:true
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Development Builds

```bash
# Build development version
fastlane build_development

# Install on device
fastlane build_development device:true
```

### 2. TestFlight Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to TestFlight
fastlane build_staging

# Monitor deployment
fastlane build_staging monitor:true
```

### 3. Production Release

```bash
# Deploy to App Store
fastlane deploy_production

# Monitor rollout
fastlane deploy_production phased:true
```

## Security Measures

### 1. Code Signing

- Managed through fastlane match
- Certificates stored in encrypted Git repository
- Automatic certificate rotation
- Strict access control

### 2. Data Security

- Keychain storage for sensitive data
- SSL pinning for network requests
- Jailbreak detection
- Runtime integrity checks

### 3. Access Control

- Face ID/Touch ID integration
- JWT token management
- Secure session handling
- Role-based access control

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Performance Monitoring

New Relic integration (v7.4.0+):
```swift
// Initialize monitoring
NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"YOUR_TOKEN")
```

### 2. Error Tracking

Sentry integration:
```swift
// Initialize error tracking
SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "YOUR_DSN"
    options.debug = false
    options.environment = "production"
}
```

### 3. Analytics

Firebase Analytics integration:
```swift
// Initialize analytics
FirebaseApp.configure()
```

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Certificate Recovery

```bash
# Regenerate certificates
fastlane match nuke development
fastlane match nuke distribution
fastlane match development
fastlane match appstore
```

### 2. Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Trigger rollback
fastlane rollback_production version:"previous_version"
```

### 3. Data Recovery

- Automatic iCloud backup integration
- Local data persistence
- Crash recovery handlers

## Support & Maintenance

### 1. Version Support
- Minimum iOS version: 14.0
- Supported devices: iPhone 8 and newer
- Regular security updates

### 2. Dependencies
- Managed via CocoaPods
- Weekly security scans
- Automated updates for patches

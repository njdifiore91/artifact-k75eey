[Binary PNG Image File with the following specifications]

Dimensions: 192x192 pixels
Color Depth: 32-bit ARGB
Format: PNG with lossless compression
Density: xxxhdpi (4.0x baseline density)
Optimization: 
- Optimal compression level
- Minimal memory impact
- High rendering priority

Design Elements:
- Flat modern style
- Brand primary and secondary colors
- Art representation with graph nodes and connections
- Crisp edges
- Minimal shadow depth

The image should be created as a high-quality PNG file that serves as the app's launcher icon for Android devices with ultra-high density screens (xxxhdpi). This icon is particularly important for pre-Android 8.0 devices that don't support adaptive icons.

The actual binary data would be generated by a graphics tool according to these specifications.
